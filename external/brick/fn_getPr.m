%---
% This MEX-file returns the pointer to the data of variable 'var'. 
% This can be very useful to understand when two Matlab variables having
% the same content do share the same pointer or not, i.e. when is the data
% of these variables shared or duplicated. Ensuring that data of large
% arrays is shared rather than duplicated will ensure efficient memory
% management.
